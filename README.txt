The following is a Python script (version 3.5) for generating an AutoHotkey script
(version 1.1.*) that can be used to have an input string of your choosing be 
replaced by a longer, more complicated string.

Once you have generated the AutoHotkey script, you may want to consider converting it to
a .exe file and encrypting it, just so prying eyes can't simply just open the script to
see what your password is for a particular website or application.

When the generated script is running, it will close out once you have entered in your
input string. This is so you can use your input string again without it being replaced
by your password.

As of August 24, 2016, AutoHotkey is only supported on Windows platforms. If you want to
